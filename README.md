**Jaguar Land Rover Remote Platform** for [Homebridge](https://homebridge.io/). This Homebridge platform supercedes the deprecated [Jaguar Land Rover InControl plug-in](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-jlr-incontrol).

You can download the Homebridge Platform from [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-jlr-remote).

## Overview

The **Jaguar Land Rover Remote Platform** will provides Apple HomeKit-compatible services and controls for:

- Battery information (EVs-only);
- Charging information (EVs-only)
- Door lock/unlocking;
- Vehicle pre-conditioning;
- Vehicle information.

The platform will provide this for each car added to the configuration and that is associated with the account.

## Configuring the platform

Example `config.json`:

```json
{
    "platforms": [{
        "name": "JaguarLandRoverRemote",
        "username": "foo@bar.uk",
        "password": "baa",
        "pin": 1234,
        "deviceId": "some UUID",
        "temperatureScale": "C",
        "vehicles": [{
            "name": "I-PACE",
            "vin": "1AAAAA111AA111111",
            "lowBatteryThreshold": 25,
            "targetTemperature": 21
        },{
            "name": "Range Rover",
            "vin": "2AAAAA111AA111111"
        }]
    }]
}
```

## Voice commands

If you use the example above, you would gain Siri commands like:

- _"What is the charge level on the I-PACE?"_ (check the **I-PACE's** battery charge level)
- _"Is the I-PACE charging?"_ (is the **I-PACE** charging?)
- _"Is the I-PACE locked?"_ (check if the **I-PACE** is locked)
- _"Turn on the I-PACE Preconditioning"_ (pre-condition the **I-PACE**)
- _"Set the I-PACE Preconditioning to 18 degrees"_
- _"Open the I-PACE"_ (unlock the **I-PACE**)
- _"Open the Range Rover"_ (unlock the **Range Rover**)
- _"Turn on the I-PACE Preconditioning"_ (pre-condition **on the I-PACE**)
- _"Heat the Range Rover to 21 degrees"_ (pre-condition **on the Range Rover**)
